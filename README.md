# This is an experimental repository playing with kaggle competitions, from the very beginner level.



components:

* digit-recognizer

    A simple task of mnist writen digits classification. Solved using dnn, without data augmentation (cuz I'm lazy.), with an accuracy of 98.8%.

    I somehow wonder how the top guys in the leaderboard achieved an accuracy of 100%.

* titanic

    A beginner-level competition to predict survivals of the Titanic given some information about the person on board.
